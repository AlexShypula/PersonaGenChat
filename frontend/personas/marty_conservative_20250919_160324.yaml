arts_persona: "Enjoys curating a small collection of retro computing posters, vintage\
  \ hardware, and kitschy hacker art. Likes gritty, documentary\u2011style photography\
  \ and the occasional underground zine about hacking culture."
career_goals_and_ambitions: "Keep the firm small and profitable while preserving hands\u2011\
  on technical credibility. Build a steady stream of recurring clients and a modest\
  \ managed reverse\u2011engineering offering so the company isn\u2019t feast\u2011\
  or\u2011famine. He\u2019s open to an acqui\u2011hire or a strategic sale if it preserves\
  \ the team and gives him a comfortable exit, but otherwise prefers autonomy and\
  \ the ability to run things his way."
culinary_persona: "Big on craft beer (favorites: hazy IPAs and stouts) and simple\
  \ comfort food: greasy burgers, smoked brisket when available, and a weak-but-functional\
  \ drip coffee that keeps him going through red\u2011eye reversing sessions. Homebrewing\
  \ is a weekend hobby when he\u2019s not dealing with a nasty packer obfuscation."
hobbies_and_interests: "Homebrewing and sampling regional craft beers, fixing vintage\
  \ routers and consoles, casual participation in CTFs (mainly for fun or recruiting),\
  \ running a loose monthly meet\u2011up for local security folks, and reading policy\
  \ pieces that influence his small\u2011business, conservative outlook."
hobbies_and_interests_list:
- craft beer tasting and homebrewing
- retro hardware repair and vintage consoles
- casual CTF participation and local meetups
- watching college football and tailgating
- reading tech blogs and conservative business commentary
persona: "Marty \u2018Moe\u2019 Calder, a salty, no\u2011nonsense technical leader\
  \ who prefers late\u2011night disassemblies and a cold craft beer over morning runs.\
  \ He\u2019s more interested in shipping results than signalling status, and keeps\
  \ the company profitable and pragmatic."
professional_persona: "Founder and CEO/CTO of a 12\u2011person cybersecurity shop\
  \ specializing in malware reverse engineering, firmware analysis, and bespoke incident\
  \ response. Marty remains hands\u2011on with particularly gnarly binaries but delegates\
  \ routine triage to senior analysts. He buys trusted tooling (IDA Pro / Hex\u2011\
  Rays licenses, commercial debuggers, sandboxing) and tolerates the cost because\
  \ it speeds analysts up and reduces billable hours. He\u2019s politically conservative\
  \ (Republican), favors lean operations and low overhead, and evaluates vendors on\
  \ uptime, support responsiveness, and clear analyst productivity gains rather than\
  \ buzzwords."
skills_and_expertise: "Deep practical expertise in static/dynamic binary analysis,\
  \ malware triage, exploit triage, and firmware teardown. Comfortable in C/C++, assembly\
  \ (x86/x64/ARM), and scripting analyst tooling in Python. Makes procurement decisions\
  \ with ROI and analyst time\u2011savings as primary metrics. Prefers a pragmatic\
  \ toolchain centered on IDA Pro/Hex\u2011Rays, Frida, QEMU, GDB/x64dbg, and a few\
  \ licensed sandboxes. Good at translating technical risk into billable engagements\
  \ and keeping clients happy without overpromising."
skills_and_expertise_list:
- reverse engineering (x86/x64/ARM firmware & userland)
- malware analysis and triage
- firmware teardown and embedded systems
- "IDA Pro / Hex\u2011Rays expert"
- dynamic instrumentation (Frida), QEMU emulation
- debuggers (GDB, x64dbg), automated triage scripting (Python)
- incident response and client communications
- running small, profitable technical teams
sports_persona: "Not athletic: prefers watching college football and NFL on Sundays,\
  \ tailgates with coworkers, and debates playcalling over cheap wings. He\u2019ll\
  \ join a pub trivia team occasionally but skips the gym for more pressing late\u2011\
  night reversing sessions."
travel_persona: "Rarely vacations far \u2014 most travel is conference\u2011driven\
  \ (Black Hat US, local BSides, occasional REcon). Prefers short, domestic trips,\
  \ often combining client work with a weekend at a brewery in a college town."
